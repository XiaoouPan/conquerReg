Conquer with Flexible Penalties

## Description

High-dimensional sparse quantile regression with flexible penalties, including lasso, elastic-net, group lasso, sparse group lasso and fused lasso.
This is a follow-up work of [He et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2021.07.010) and [Tan, Wang and Zhou, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1111/rssb.12485). 

Algorithmically, all these methods can be flexibly implemented using iteratively reweighted *&ell;<sub>1</sub>*-penalization and a local minimize-majorize approximation.
